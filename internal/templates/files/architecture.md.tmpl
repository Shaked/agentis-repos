<!-- High-level description of what this system does and its main purpose -->

## Components

<!-- List and describe the main components/modules of the system -->

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| <!-- Component name --> | <!-- What it does --> | <!-- Path or module --> |

## Data Flow

<!-- Describe how data flows through the system -->

```
<!-- ASCII diagram or description of data flow -->
```

## Key Design Decisions

<!-- Document important architectural decisions and their rationale -->

1. **Decision**: <!-- What was decided -->
   - **Context**: <!-- Why this decision was needed -->
   - **Rationale**: <!-- Why this approach was chosen -->

## Integration Points

<!-- External systems, APIs, or services this system interacts with -->

| System | Purpose | Protocol |
|--------|---------|----------|
| <!-- External system --> | <!-- Why we integrate --> | <!-- REST/gRPC/etc --> |

## Dependencies

<!-- Key internal and external dependencies -->

- <!-- Dependency and why it's needed -->

## Security Considerations

<!-- Security-relevant architectural notes -->
