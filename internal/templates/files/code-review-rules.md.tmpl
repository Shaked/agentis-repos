# Code Review Rules

> Code review requirements for CI/CD automation and human reviewers.

## Reviewer Skills Required

- Understand the codebase architecture and patterns
- Verify changes follow established conventions
- Identify security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns
- Assess test coverage and quality
- Evaluate performance implications

## Review Checklist

### Universal Requirements

- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or API keys committed
- [ ] Error handling is present and appropriate
- [ ] Tests cover the changes adequately
- [ ] No commented-out code without explanation
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME without associated tracking
- [ ] Changes are backwards compatible (or breaking changes documented)

### Style & Formatting

- [ ] Code follows project linting rules
- [ ] Naming conventions are consistent

### Security Patterns

- [ ] Input validation present at boundaries
- [ ] No hardcoded sensitive values
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly enforced
- [ ] SQL/injection vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] No obvious N+1 queries or inefficient loops
- [ ] Resource cleanup (connections, files, memory)
- [ ] Appropriate caching where beneficial
- [ ] No blocking operations in hot paths

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for new logic
- [ ] Integration tests for new endpoints/interfaces
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] Test names describe the scenario

### Architecture

- [ ] Changes align with existing patterns
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced
