- Database migrations require DBA approval
-->

## Dependencies Policy

<!-- How to add/update dependencies. Examples:
- New dependencies require team discussion
- Pin all dependency versions

## Branch Strategy

<!-- Document branching model. Examples:
- main: production-ready code
- develop: integration branch
- feature/*: new features
- fix/*: bug fixes

## Deployment Notes

<!-- Document deployment considerations. Examples:
- Feature flags required for new features
- Database migrations run automatically
- Rollback procedure: revert commit and redeploy
