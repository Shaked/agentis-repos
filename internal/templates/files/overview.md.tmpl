## Shared Resources
- Root `.agentignore` applies to all projects
- Root `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs checks on all projects
- Root `Makefile` provides cross-project commands

## Navigation
- Each project has its own `AGENTS.md` and `.agent/` directory
- Read the relevant project's context before making changes
- Use root-level commands for cross-project operations
